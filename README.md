         Project Girl is a venture that will sponsor Cambodian girls' education by selling coffee.   
         </p>
        
        <p> 
            <b> Problem: </b>
         Cambodia is a low income country and close to 80% of the population suffers from poverty.  The combination of the country's poverty and increased tourism have unfortunately resulted in high amounts of sexual exploitation.    
      </p>
        
        <p> 
            <b> Why Does it Matter?:</b> 
            Young, illiterate girls are especially vulnerable to human trafficking, and continue to have limited opportunities due to family and economic pressures. Girls are pressured to stay home, take care of their siblings, and farm in their family's fields. As a result, they do not attend school, remain illiterate, and face a deprived future. 
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            <b> What Do We Do?: </b> 
            PRJ GRL hopes to send as many girls to school as possible. We will do this by contributing to UNICEF's Girls Be Ambitious Program. Girls Be Ambitious uses donated funds to provide financial assistance to Cambodian families so that they are able to send their girls to school. 50% of our coffee revenue will be sent to the initiative. 
        </p>

            <b> Additional Information </b> 
        </p>
          
          <p> 
            <b> Who Are We?: </b> 
              We are two seniors studying business at the University of Maryland in College Park. PRJ GRL is more than just an extracurricular or side project. We are lucky enough to know exactly what our dream job is - and it’s a running a successful social venture.
        </p>      
                
          <p> 
            <b> Why Coffee?: </b>
              Coffee energizes and gives us the extra boost needed to accomplish the tasks we set out to do  each and every day. It represents productivity and committment to working hard. Our committment is to empower women through education, and we believe there is no better product to represent our message.  
        </p>
          
           <p> 
            <b> Target Market: </b> 
               Our target market is general consumers, especially young adults. We want to empower these consumers through their spending. In today’s world, you don’t have to volunteer hours of your time or directly donate money to a cause to help enact change. While these acts are selfless, they are not sustainable. Today’s consumers are seeking more than affluence and materialism, they are seeking meaning. By providing a product that consumers need, we can provide a third option for people to help girls in Cambodia go to school, while also leaving consumers with a warm cup of coffee.
